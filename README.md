# Campfire
Discussion thread for improved thread management and grading. 

## Features
1. Create forums for a course version to make them available for sections of the course.
* Create specific threads inside a forum that provide discussion structure for participants.
* Create scales for instructors to evaluate posts including:
  1. Credit/no credit checkbox-style scale that awards full credit or no credit to a post.
  * Whole number scale that provides an integer selection scale from 0 to the scale's max number.
  * Factional number scale the provides an open number box allowing the instructor to provide decimal values.
  * Custom scale that allows for a more fine-tuned scale with individual items 
    to indicate specific increments of points and   labels for each increment.
* Participants link to a specific forum from the LMS and then authenticate into a specific section.
* Participants post inside of threads in a tree-like structure.
* Participants can edit their own posts until someone has replied to it.
* Instructors can make their own posts private so as to give private feedback to a student.
* Instructors can rate individual posts using the scale that is configured for the post's thread 
  so as to "score" student participation.
* Forums and threads each have a participation report that shows:
  1. Each participant in alphabetical order
  * How many posts each made
  * How many replies each made
  * Full total of points for each student
  * Capped total of points for each student
  * Average post score for each student
  * (Forum reports aggregate from all threads within that forum)
